# SprinklrClientSamples
A collection of python command line tools that use the Sprinklr Client Library
This is a work in progress, but wanted an online backup.

The SprinklrClient library located here is a bit newer than the one in the main library. The main change being Asset APIs have been tested and fixed.

I'll be pushing out an updated library soon!
